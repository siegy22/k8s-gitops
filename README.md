# k8s-gitops

This repository contains the GitOps configuration for my personal Kubernetes cluster hosted on DigitalOcean, managed using ArgoCD. It follows the "App of Apps" pattern to organize and deploy applications and infrastructure components.

## Getting Started

1. **ArgoCD Deployment**:
   - This configuration requires ArgoCD to be installed in the cluster. For instructions, visit [ArgoCD's documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

2. **Manual Configuration**:
   - The initial setup requires manual application of the `app-of-apps.yaml` manifest to register the core applications in ArgoCD.

```bash
kubectl apply -f app-of-apps.yaml
```
